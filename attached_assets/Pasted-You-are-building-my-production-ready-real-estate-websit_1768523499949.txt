You are building my production-ready real estate website.

Brand / Agent info (use everywhere):
- Name: Griffin Sweet
- Brand format: “Griffin Sweet – The Agency Real Estate”
- Brokerage line: “THEAGENCY – A Global Marketing and Sales Organization”
- License: CA DRE 02078712
- Phone: 310.339.1171
- Email: Griffin.Sweet@TheAgencyRE.com

GOALS (must achieve):
1) Luxury, minimal, fast, mobile-first site (Luxury Presence vibe but not a clone).
2) Capture leads everywhere (forms + clear CTAs) and route them into Follow Up Boss via Make webhook.
3) Install my tracking pixel site-wide (WidgetBe/FUB tracker) and track pageviews on route changes.
4) Add IDX home search using The MLS idxcellent iframe with a mobile fallback that opens full-screen.
5) SEO friendly: proper titles/descriptions per page, OG tags, sitemap.xml, robots.txt, JSON-LD for RealEstateAgent.

STACK (required):
- Next.js App Router + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Clean component structure, no heavy dependencies.

PAGES (required):
- / (Home)
- /about
- /portfolio
- /home-search (IDX)
- /neighborhoods + these pages:
  /neighborhoods/silver-lake
  /neighborhoods/los-feliz
  /neighborhoods/studio-city
  /neighborhoods/sherman-oaks
  /neighborhoods/santa-monica
  /neighborhoods/brentwood
  /neighborhoods/pacific-palisades
  /neighborhoods/mar-vista
  /neighborhoods/venice
- /insights (blog index) + /insights/[slug] post template
- /contact
- /privacy
- /terms

NAV:
Home, About, Portfolio, Home Search, Neighborhoods, Insights, Contact
Header must include a right-side CTA button: “Schedule a Call” linking to /contact.

PORTFOLIO REQUIREMENTS:
- Create /data/transactions.json with 8 sample entries (placeholder data) using this schema:
  id, address_display, city, zip, neighborhood, property_type, role, close_date, close_price, beds, baths, sqft, notes, photo_url (optional), external_url (optional)
- /portfolio renders a grid from that JSON, filterable by neighborhood and role (lightweight).
- Include a button: “View Full Portfolio on The Agency” linking to:
  https://www.theagencyre.com/agent/griffin-sweet

IDX REQUIREMENTS (use exactly these URLs and settings):
- Add the MLS script:
  https://www.themls.com/IDXNET/Scripts/idxwidget.js
- Add the iframe with:
  id="idxFrame"
  src="https://www.themls.com/IDXNET/Default.aspx?wid=b01Wje8lbgFKViKluuKgwPaRPXrW75VUeI0PW5ZawIsnJdPzvX6HugEQLEQL"
  Desktop: centered, max width 1024, height 900, scrolling="no", border 0, transparent background.
  Mobile (below 900px width): DO NOT embed; show a button “Open Home Search” that opens the iframe src in a new tab.

TRACKING REQUIREMENTS (WidgetBe/FUB tracker):
- Install this tracker site-wide. It must load after the page becomes interactive.
- It must send "pageview" on initial load and on Next.js route changes:

(function(w,i,d,g,e,t){w["WidgetTrackerObject"]=g;(w[g]=w[g]||function(){(w[g].q=w[g].q||[]).push(arguments);}),(w[g].ds=1*new Date());(e="script"),(t=d.createElement(e)),(e=d.getElementsByTagName(e)[0]);t.async=1;t.src=i;e.parentNode.insertBefore(t,e);})
(window,"https://widgetbe.com/agent",document,"widgetTracker");
window.widgetTracker("create", "WT-FFQUWKYJ");
window.widgetTracker("send", "pageview");

LEAD CAPTURE REQUIREMENTS:
- Add lead forms on: Home (hero), Contact page, and below the IDX embed (desktop).
- Form fields: full_name, email, phone, intent (Buyer/Seller/Not sure), timeline, message.
- Include a required consent checkbox:
  “By submitting, you agree to receive calls/texts/emails from Griffin Sweet. Reply STOP to opt out.”
- On submit, POST JSON to /api/lead with extra hidden fields:
  pageUrl, referrer, utm_source, utm_medium, utm_campaign, utm_term, utm_content
- Create the API route /api/lead that forwards the payload to a Make webhook:
  process.env.MAKE_WEBHOOK_URL
- If MAKE_WEBHOOK_URL is missing, the API must return a clear error.

DELIVERABLES:
- Full working code.
- README.md that explains:
  1) Run locally
  2) Deploy to Vercel
  3) Connect GoDaddy domain
  4) Where to edit transactions.json
  5) Where to set MAKE_WEBHOOK_URL
  6) Where the MLS embed lives
Now build the site.
